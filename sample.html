  <p style="font-size: 20px;">html (hypertext markup language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. it acts like the blueprint for web pages, telling the browser how to display text, images, links, forms, tables, and other elements. html uses tags written within angle brackets like h1, p, or img to define different types of content.
each html page starts with a basic structure, including the doctype declaration, an html tag to enclose everything, a head section for metadata and styles, and a body section that holds the visible content. tags like a for hyperlinks, ul for lists, and div for dividing sections are building blocks for layout and interactivity.
html is static by itself, but it often works with css for styling and javascript for dynamic behavior to build fully interactive websites. it is essential knowledge for anyone interested in web development, especially full stack roles.
